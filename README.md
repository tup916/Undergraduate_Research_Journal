# Undergraduate_Research_Journal
I helped redesign University of Saskatchewan's Undergraduate Research Journal (USURJ). I used a little bit of php, however, majority of the design was done by using an interface.

Status: Currently under construction.
Because the website has its own interface, no code can be put here.

Link to the final product will be put here soon.
